      Make sure your program is saved since debugging requires a saved file for VS Code to analyze.
      Set breakpoints: These are points in your code where execution will pause, allowing you to inspect variables and the program state. Click on the line number next to the line of code where you want to pause.
      Start Debugging:
      Go to the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D). 
      Click the green "Run and Debug" button or press F5.

      Watch Window: Monitor the values of specific variables during execution to identify changes that might cause errors

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control

      1. Initialize a Repository:

      Open your project folder in VS Code.
      Click on the Source Control icon (gear symbol) in the Activity bar and select "Initialize Repository". This creates a new Git repository in your project folder.
      2. Making Commits:

      Make changes to your code.
      Stage changes you want to include in your next commit using the Source Control view (blue checkmark icon) or right-click on files and select "Stage Changes".
      Type a descriptive commit message summarizing your changes.
      Commit your staged changes (green checkmark icon).
      3. Pushing Changes to GitHub:

      You'll need a GitHub account and a remote repository set up.
